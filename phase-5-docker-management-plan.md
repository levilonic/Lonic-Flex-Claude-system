# Phase 5: Docker Management & Container Lifecycle

**Project**: testing project feature by building  
**Phase**: 5 of 8  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 4 complete (GitHub advanced integration)  
**Current Status**: Basic Docker integration, needs advanced lifecycle management  

## üéØ Objective

Implement comprehensive Docker container management with lifecycle controls, security, monitoring, and production-ready deployment capabilities.

## üìã Current Docker Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components (After Phase 2)
- **Docker Engine**: Connection working
- **DeployAgent**: Basic container operations
- **DockerManager**: Container lifecycle basics
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service orchestration

### ‚ùå Missing Components (From 41-Task Roadmap)
- **Advanced container lifecycle management**
- **Docker network isolation and security**
- **Log rotation and resource monitoring**
- **Container health checks and auto-recovery**

## üîß Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Advanced Container Lifecycle Management
1. **Container lifecycle automation**:
   - Startup dependency management
   - Graceful shutdown procedures
   - Health check integration
   - Auto-restart policies
   - Resource cleanup automation

2. **Deployment strategies**:
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Rolling updates
   - Canary releases
   - Rollback procedures
   - Zero-downtime deployments

### Step 2: Network Security & Isolation
1. **Custom network management**:
   - Isolated container networks
   - Inter-service communication rules
   - Network segmentation
   - Traffic monitoring and logging

2. **Security enhancements**:
   - Container security scanning
   - Runtime security monitoring
   - Secrets management
   - User and permission management
   - Resource limits enforcement

### Step 3: Monitoring & Resource Management
1. **Resource monitoring**:
   - CPU, memory, disk usage tracking
   - Network bandwidth monitoring
   - Container performance metrics
   - Resource usage alerts

2. **Log management**:
   - Centralized log aggregation
   - Log rotation policies
   - Log retention management
   - Structured logging implementation
   - Real-time log streaming

### Step 4: Production Readiness Features
1. **High availability**:
   - Container redundancy
   - Load balancing integration
   - Failover procedures
   - Disaster recovery planning

2. **Backup and recovery**:
   - Container state backups
   - Volume backup strategies
   - Configuration backup
   - Recovery procedures testing

## ‚ö° Success Criteria

- [ ] Advanced container lifecycle management operational
- [ ] Network isolation and security implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- [ ] Production-ready deployment strategies
- [ ] High availability and disaster recovery

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Duration

**4-5 hours**: Docker security and production features require careful implementation.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next Phase

Phase 6: Production Configuration & Secrets Management
