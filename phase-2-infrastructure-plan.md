# Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup & Agent Verification

**Project**: testing project feature by building  
**Phase**: 2 of 8  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 complete (Phase 3B at 100%)  
**Current Status**: Infrastructure partially working, Docker Engine connection issue  

## üéØ Objective

Set up and verify all infrastructure components, fix Docker Engine connectivity, and ensure all agents are fully operational.

## üìã Current Infrastructure Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- **SQLite Database**: WAL mode, all tables operational
- **Universal Context System**: 100% working (28/28 tests)
- **Phase 3A External Integration**: 100% working (8/8 tests)
- **Phase 3B Long-Term Persistence**: 100% working (after Phase 1)
- **BaseAgent**: Working with Factor 10 compliance
- **GitHubAgent**: Working with real API integration
- **CommAgent**: Working with Slack integration

### ‚ùå Broken Components
- **Docker Engine**: `connect ENOENT //./pipe/docker_engine`
- **DeployAgent**: Depends on Docker Engine

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Unverified Components
- **SecurityAgent**: Has test command but not recently verified
- **CodeAgent**: Has test command but not recently verified  
- **MultiplanManagerAgent**: Available but needs testing

## üîß Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Docker Engine Setup (Windows)
1. **Diagnose Docker connectivity issue**:
   ```bash
   docker version
   docker info
   ```
2. **Fix Docker Engine connection**:
   - Check if Docker Desktop is running
   - Verify Windows pipe permissions
   - Alternative: Set up Docker via WSL2 if needed
   - Test basic Docker functionality: `docker run hello-world`

3. **Verify Docker integration**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo-docker-manager
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Agent Verification
1. **Test DeployAgent after Docker fix**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo-deploy-agent
   ```
2. **Verify real container operations**:
   - Image building working
   - Container deployment working
   - Health checks functional
   - Network configuration correct

### Step 3: Agent Verification Suite
1. **Run all individual agent tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo-base-agent      # ‚úÖ Known working
   npm run demo-github-agent    # ‚úÖ Known working  
   npm run demo-security-agent  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs verification
   npm run demo-code-agent      # ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs verification
   npm run demo-deploy-agent    # ‚ùå Needs Docker fix first
   npm run demo-comm-agent      # ‚úÖ Known working
   npm run demo-multiplan-manager # ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs verification
   ```

2. **Document agent status and capabilities**:
   - Update AGENT-REGISTRY.md with verified status
   - Note any configuration requirements
   - Document known limitations or dependencies

### Step 4: Multi-Agent Coordination Testing  
1. **Test full multi-agent workflow**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo
   ```
2. **Verify agent handoff and coordination**:
   - Sequential workflow execution
   - Context preservation between agents
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance and timing

### Step 5: External Integration Verification
1. **GitHub integration testing**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo-github-agent
   ```
   - Verify GITHUB_TOKEN working
   - Test branch creation and PR management
   - Check rate limiting handling

2. **Slack integration testing**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo-comm-agent
   npm run slack-diagnose
   ```
   - Verify all Slack tokens configured
   - Test notification system
   - Check interactive features

### Step 6: Database and Memory Systems
1. **Database integrity check**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo-db
   ```
2. **Memory system verification**:
   ```bash
   npm run demo-memory
   npm run verify-all
   ```
3. **Status verification system**:
   ```bash
   npm run verify-discrepancies
   ```

## ‚ö° Success Criteria

- [ ] Docker Engine connection working
- [ ] All 7 agents verified and functional
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination working end-to-end
- [ ] External integrations (GitHub/Slack) operational
- [ ] Database and memory systems stable
- [ ] No infrastructure blocking issues remain

## üö® Risk Assessment & Mitigation

**High Risk: Docker Engine Issue**
- **Impact**: DeployAgent completely non-functional
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Try multiple Docker setup approaches
  - Document workaround if Docker unavailable
  - Ensure other agents work without Docker dependency

**Medium Risk: Unverified Agents**
- **Impact**: Unknown agent stability
- **Mitigation**: Test each agent individually before integration

**Low Risk: External API Dependencies**  
- **Impact**: GitHub/Slack features may be limited
- **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation already implemented

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Duration

**3-4 hours**: Docker troubleshooting may take time; agent verification should be quick.

## üì¶ Deliverables

1. **Fully operational Docker Engine** with container support
2. **All 7 agents verified and documented** in AGENT-REGISTRY.md
3. **Working multi-agent coordination** with full workflow
4. **Updated infrastructure documentation** 
5. **Verified external integrations** (GitHub + Slack)
6. **Infrastructure health report** with all systems green

## üîß Tools and Commands Reference

```bash
# Docker verification
docker version && docker info
docker run hello-world

# Individual agent testing
for agent in base github security code deploy comm multiplan-manager; do
  echo "Testing $agent agent..."
  npm run demo-$agent-agent
done

# System verification
npm run demo                    # Full workflow
npm run verify-all              # Status verification
npm run slack-diagnose          # Slack configuration
npm run test-multi-branch       # Branch operations

# Database and memory
npm run demo-db                 # Database functionality
npm run demo-memory             # Memory system
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next Phase

Phase 3: Complete Slack Integration (bot implementation, slash commands, workflows)
