# Lonic-Flex-Claude-system

**Production Multi-Agent Coordination System with Real GitHub Integration**

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test real GitHub integration (NOT demo mode)
node test-github-api.js

# Run multi-agent coordination 
npm run demo

# Verify individual agents
npm run verify-all
```

## ✅ Verified Working Systems

- **GitHub Agent**: ✅ Real API integration with anthropics/claude-code
- **Multi-Agent Core**: ✅ Coordination works until Docker step
- **Authentication**: ✅ Real GitHub token integration
- **Database**: ✅ SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent operations
- **Context System**: ✅ Anti-auto-compact XML format

## 🤖 Agent Status

| Agent | Status | Test Command |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| GitHub | ✅ WORKING | Real API calls with rate limits verified |
| Base | ✅ WORKING | `npm run demo-base-agent` |
| Security | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | `npm run demo-security-agent` |
| Code | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | `npm run demo-code-agent` |
| Deploy | ❌ BROKEN | Requires Docker Engine |

## 🔧 Current Blockers

- **Docker Infrastructure**: Deploy agent requires Docker Engine running
- **Remaining Agents**: Security, Code, Comm agents need individual testing

## 📋 Architecture

This system implements 12-Factor Agent methodology with:
- Real multi-agent coordination (not demo mode)
- SQLite persistence with concurrent agent sessions
- GitHub webhook integration for event-driven workflows
- Production Docker stack with monitoring and metrics

## 🔗 Original Documentation

The original 12-Factor Agents methodology is preserved in [12-FACTOR-AGENTS-ORIGINAL.md](./12-FACTOR-AGENTS-ORIGINAL.md).

## 🎯 LonicFLex Extensions

- `/lonicflex-init` command for instant context loading
- Real GitHub API integration with verified authentication
- Multi-agent session management with database coordination
- Anti-bullshit verification system preventing false claims
- Production-ready webhook and deployment infrastructure

---

**Status**: Core multi-agent system operational with real GitHub integration. Docker infrastructure repair needed for full deployment functionality.
